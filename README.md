# üêç Monty Interpreter
## By [Yuan Fang](https://github.com/yuan-fang-228) and Matthew Brinkmann
This is a simple interpreter for the monty coding language.
### About the language
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.
   
### Monty byte code files
   
Files containing Monty byte codes usually have the .m extension. Most of the industry uses this standard but it is not required by the specification of the language. There is not more than one instruction per line. There can be any number of spaces before or after the opcode and its argument:

## :arrow_down: Installing and Using

Clone the repository into a new directory:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Matthew-brinkmann/monty
```
Compile with the following:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o monty
```

Run the interpreter on a file:

```
./monty file.m
```
## :computer: Technical

* [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS] - operating system

* [GCC 9.4.0] - compiled
## :pushpin: Functions

* **push**
  * Usage: `push <int>`
  * Pushes an element to the stack.

* **pall**
  * Prints all values in the stack/queue, starting from the top.
  * Prints nothing if stack is empty

* **pint**
  * Prints the top value of the stack/queue.
  * Prints ERROR if stack is empty

* **pop**
  * Removes the top element of the stack/queue.
  * Prints ERROR if stack is empty

* **swap**
  * Swaps the top two elements of the stack/queue.
  * Prints ERROR if stack is less than 2 elements

* **nop**
  * Does not do anything.

* **add**
  * Adds the top two elements of the stack.
  * The result is stored in the second element from the top and the top element is removed.

* **sub**
  * Subtracts the top element of the stack from the second element from the top.
  * The result is stored in the second element from the top and the top element is removed.

* **mul**
  * Multiplies the top two elements of the stack.
  * The result is stored in the second element from the top and the top element is removed.

* **div**
  * Divides the second element from the top of the stack by the top element.
  * The result is stored in the second element from the top and the top element is removed.
  * The top element can not be 0(zero)

* **mod**
  * Computes the modulus of the second element from the top of the stack divided by the top element.
  * The result is stored in the second element from the top and the top element is removed.
  * The top element can not be 0(zero)

* **stack**
  * sets the format of the data to a stack (LIFO). This is the default behavior of the program.

* **queue**
  * sets the format of the data to a queue (FIFO).

* **pchar**
  * prints the char at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.
  * The integer stored at the top of the stack is treated as the ascii value of the character to be printed and must exist in the ASCII table.
  * If the stack is empty, will cause an error

* **pstr**
  * prints the string starting at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.
  * The integer stored in each element of the stack is treated as the ascii value of the character to be printed.
  * will stop if stack is over, reaches element 0 or the value is out of range for the ASCII table.
  * if the stack is empty, this funciton will print a new line.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: functions are case sensitive and capital letters will not work.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: Lines that start with a `#` comments and the whole line is ignored.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: Lines can be empty and can contain any number of spaces before or after an opcode and its argument (only the first opcode and/or argument is taken into account).
